This is a first sketch for a UI proposal for BrowserCMS.

You can open the svg file in Inkscape of view the html with Firefox 3.5.

If you open the html file you can click on these three buttons:

- The "Edit properties"-button in the top navigation bar
- The blue "+"-button 
- The up/down-arrows-button in one of the small grey menus


Basic ideas
- Get rid of "zombie"-buttons (greyish, unresponsive buttons)
- Minimize administrative depris in top toolbar and visual editor
- Use overlay/window for editing page properties and reordering blocks to stay in context
- Only highlight draft pages, not published pages
- Use "warning tape" on draft pages and pages that are assigned to current user. 
  These show additional information and provide access to functionality formerly provided via zombies.

TODO Write more about why is all this an improvement.
TODO Discuss, then make a working html mockup
